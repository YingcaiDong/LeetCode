After almost four years, we met again! This is literaly my first interview question in my life. It was 2016 Janary at Intel. Things would
be different if I start using leetcode earlier (sigh).

```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int Trap(int[] height)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        int maxLeftHeight = 0, maxRightHeight = 0;  /// Current water max hight reference.
        int leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = height.Length - 1;
        while (leftIndex < rightIndex)
        {
            /// Select start direction
            if (height[leftIndex] < height[rightIndex])
            {
                /// When left height smaller than right index.
                /// There must be at least one pound of water.
                /// The water height is left height.
                /// So set left height as reference and go to right.
                if (height[leftIndex] < maxLeftHeight)
                {
                    /// Collect water volume.
                    sum += maxLeftHeight - height[leftIndex];
                }
                else
                {
                    /// Elevate the water level.
                    maxLeftHeight = height[leftIndex];
                }
                leftIndex++;
            }
            else
            {
                /// When right height smaller than left index.
                /// Must contain water between them.
                /// Water max height is right height.
                /// Use right height as reference, search to left.
                if (height[rightIndex] < maxRightHeight)
                {
                    sum += maxRightHeight - height[rightIndex];
                }
                else
                {
                    maxRightHeight = height[rightIndex];
                }
                rightIndex--;
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
