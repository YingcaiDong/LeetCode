I can feel that the author is expecting a mathematical solution.
However, I took a short cut: Merge two array, sort it from small to heigh. Then find the middle number.

The build-in sort method has already optimized in speed, plus the two input array are pre-sorted. The sorting time-complexicty isn't
going to the the worse.

But i still suggest you check the mathematical solution when you review this question next time: [Link](https://medium.com/@hazemu/finding-the-median-of-2-sorted-arrays-in-logarithmic-time-1d3f2ecbeb46)

```c#
public class Solution
{
    List<int> l = new List<int>();
    public double FindMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.Length; i++)
        {
            l.Add(nums1[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.Length; i++)
        {
            l.Add(nums2[i]);
        }
        l.Sort();
        if (l.Count % 2 == 1)
        {
            return l[(l.Count - 1) / 2];
        }
        else
        {
            int a = l[l.Count / 2];
            int b = l[l.Count / 2 - 1];
            return (double)(a + b) / 2;
        }
    }
}
```
